In imperative programming, you tell the computer what to do. \"Computer, add x and y,\" or \"Computer, slap a dialog box onto the screen.\" The focus is on what steps the computer should take rather than what the computer will do (ex.

      "A programming _object_ is a data structure which seeks to model the real world by associating parameters and functions in a natural way.  For instance, when you interact with your car, you don't think of an abstract button before changing your radio station, nor do you think of an abstract radio.  You simply press the button on the radio.  Similarly with code, it is often more natural to say `car.radio.freq.up()` than `increment(frequency(radio(car))))`, although both could be possible ways of thinking of the problem.\n",
