{"name":"Python-Sp15","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in Python, Spring 2015","body":"All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, L440 Digital Computer Laboratory.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\nL440 DCL is a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before.  It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.\r\n\r\n![](./img/map-l440.png)\r\n\r\n# Setup (Canopy Python and I-Python Notebook)\r\n\r\nFor most of the lessons, we will require outside modules.  While several methods for managing your own library of modules exists, we will use [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), which is installed on your EWS machines already.  However, it works best when you are logged in with a Canopy user account, and [free academic accounts](https://store.enthought.com/accounts/login/?next=/licenses/academic/request/) are available and recommended.\r\n\r\nTo load Canopy, please input the following at a terminal window:\r\n\r\n    module load canopy\r\n\r\nIn many cases, we will also use [I-Python](http://ipython.org/) notebooks, which are interactive workbooks for code.  To open these, please navigate on the command line to your home directory (or wherever your downloaded `ipynb` files are located), and open the I-Python notebook interface:\r\n\r\n    cd\r\n    module load canopy\r\n    ipython notebook &\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Python](#intro)\r\n## January 28, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Numerical & Scientific Programming with Python (`numpy`, `scipy`)](#numpy)\r\n## February 4, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Data Analysis with Python (`pandas`)](#pandas)\r\n## February 11, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Plotting in Python (`matplotlib`)](#matplotlib)\r\n## February 18, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Advanced Programming in Python](#advanced)\r\n## February 25, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Machine Learning in Python (`scikit-learn`)](#sklearn)\r\n## March 4, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Error handling in Python (`pdb`, numerical error)](#pdb)\r\n## March 11, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# [Optimizing Numerical Code in Python](#opt)\r\n## March 18, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n# About These Workshops\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nNeal Davis and Lakshmi Rao developed these materials.
