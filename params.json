{"name":"Python-Sp15","tagline":"CSE Training Workshops in Python, Spring 2015","body":"All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, L440 Digital Computer Laboratory.  There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!\r\n\r\nL440 DCL is a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before.  It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.\r\n\r\n![](./img/map-l440.png)\r\n\r\n# Setup (Python and Jupyter Notebook)\r\n\r\nFor most of the lessons, we will require outside modules.  While several methods for managing your own library of modules exists, we will use [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/), which is installed on your EWS machines already.  [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) is another excellent Python distribution for your home machine.\r\n\r\n# [Introduction to Python](#intro)\r\n## January 28, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\n- [Lesson Notes](https://github.com/uiuc-cse/python-sp15/blob/gh-pages/lessons/intro.md)\r\n\r\n# [Numerical & Scientific Programming with Python (`numpy`, `scipy`)](#numpy)\r\n## February 4, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\nWe will use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (formerly [I-Python](http://ipython.org/)), which are interactive worksheets for code.  To open these, please navigate on the command line to your home directory (or wherever your downloaded `ipynb` files are located), and open the Jupyter notebook interface:\r\n\r\n    cd\r\n    module load canopy\r\n    ipython notebook\r\n\r\n##### Lesson Workbooks\r\n - [Blank workbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-sp15/gh-pages/lessons/numpy-scipy-working.ipynb) (please download)\r\n - [Full workbook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/python-sp15/gh-pages/lessons/numpy-scipy.ipynb) (use for your later reference)\r\n - [Static view of workbook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/uiuc-cse/python-sp15/blob/gh-pages/lessons/numpy-scipy.ipynb) (if you don't have Python installed)\r\n\r\n# [Data Analysis with Python (`pandas`)](#pandas)\r\n## February 11, 10 am–noon\r\n\r\nThis lesson will introduce the basics of the [`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/) module, a popular library for interacting with data and discovering trends.\r\n\r\nWe will use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks (formerly [I-Python](http://ipython.org/)), which are interactive worksheets for code.  To open these, please navigate on the command line to your home directory (or wherever your downloaded `ipynb` files are located), and open the Jupyter notebook interface:\r\n\r\n    cd\r\n    module load canopy\r\n    ipython notebook\r\n\r\n##### Lesson Workbooks\r\n -
